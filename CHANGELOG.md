## [1.0.0] — Unreleased (first public release)

### Added
- Global-hotkey dictation with push-to-talk and toggle (tap-to-latch) modes; `Esc` cancels a recording.
- Cloud engines: Gemini, OpenAI (Whisper + GPT), Groq (Whisper + Llama) with per-provider API keys.
- Local engine: whisper.cpp sidecar, model download manager (tiny/base/small/medium) with delete option.
- AI transcript cleanup: punctuation, grammar, filler-word removal; voice editing of selected text.
- Experimental live streaming mode with smart diff typing and adaptive chunk intervals.
- Transcription history (last 50 entries) with one-click copy.
- Custom dictionary hints, 9 fixed recognition languages + auto/keyboard-layout detection.
- Optional voice punctuation commands (Russian).
- Overlay with live waveform, recording timer, localized status/error messages and sound themes (zen / rhodes / sci-fi / classic) with volume control.
- Autostart with Windows, tray icon, single-instance guard.
- Focus guard: simulated typing/paste never lands in a window the user switched to mid-dictation.
- Windows system proxy support and network timeouts for cloud requests.

### Fixed
- Silence-hallucination filter no longer discards legitimate dictation containing marker words.
- Clipboard contents can no longer leak into cloud prompts when nothing is selected.
- Race between the streaming loop and final transcription (session generation counter).
- Blocking whisper.cpp/typing calls moved off the async runtime.
- Sidecar discovery works in dev and bundled builds; runtime DLLs ship with the installer.
- Model name validation prevents directory traversal.
